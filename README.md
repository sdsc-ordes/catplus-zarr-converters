# Cat+ Zarr Converters

## About

This repository contains all the converters for the different data types in the Cat+ project (Agilent, UV, IR, etc.)
The data types are all in different formats, their data and metadata colluded together. The goal will be to convert the metadata to [an established ontology](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/catplus-ontology/tree/main), and provide the data in their original files.

## Tools

### converter
The converter parses a json input into an rdf graph and serializes the graph to either turtle or jsonld.
It expects the input to conform to the cat+ ontology and the struct `src/catplus-common/src/models/types.rs`. Example input files are provided in `examples` directory.

#### Usage

The `converter` has four arguments:

- input_type: currently `synth` (see `examples/1-Synth.json`) or `hci` (see `examples/0-HCI.json`)
- inputfile: path to input file (relative to top level of the repo or absolute)
- outputfile: path to output file (relative to top level of the repo or absolute)
- format: rdf output format, currently `turtle` or `jsonld`

The `converter` turns the inputfile into a rdf graph and serializes it to either turtle or jsonld. The serialization is written to the provided outputfile.

Examples

```
just run synth examples/1-Synth.json examples/1-Synth.ttl turtle
just run hci examples/0-HCI.json examples/0-HCI.ttl jsonld
```

#### Deployment

The rust code can be packaged and built into a docker image through Nix derivations. 
Execute the following commands: 

```
just --unstable docker build-nix-package
just --unstable docker build-nix-image
just --unstable docker push-image
```

### Architecture

The json input is read with `serde_json`: the transformation into rdf is done by the `src/catplus-common` library.
It uses `sophia_rs`. The mapping is triggered by `src/catplus-common/src/models/types.rs` and makes use of the namespaces defined at `src/catplus-common/src/graph/namespaces`.

### Shacl Validation

The rdf graph confirms to the cat+ ontology: https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/catplus-ontology. Currently rust offeres no Shacl Validation Library, but once such a library exists, it would make sense to add a Shacl Validation.

The Shacl Validation can be done manually here: https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/shacl/any/upload

## Installation guidelines

The repo is setup with nix.

```
git clone git@github.com:sdsc-ordes/catplus-converters.git
cd catplus-converters
cargo build
```

From here on you can work with a just file:

The rust commands can be started via a justfile:

```
just --list
Available recipes:
    build *args                                 # Build all crates
    default                                     # Default recipe to list all recipes.
    format *args                                # Format all crates
    fmt *args                                   # alias for `format`
    nix-develop *args                           # Enter a Nix development shell.
    run input_type input_file output_file *args # Run the converter.
    test *args                                  # Test all crates
```

### Tests

Run the tests with `just test`: only integration tests have been integrated that ensure that the serialized graph in turtle is isomorphic to an expected turtle serialization of the input data.

### Contribute

The repo is a Poc under heavy development and not yet ready to take contributions.
